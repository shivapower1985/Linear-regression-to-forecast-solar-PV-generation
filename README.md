# Linear-regression-to-forecast-solar-PV-generation
Created by: Shivashankar Sukumar
I had created a basic linear regression model to predict the solar PV generation. To predict the solar PV generation of the present day, latest 21 days solar PV generation is considered. Here 17 days data is used for training and 4 days data is used for testing.
